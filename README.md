# PlayingCards
Custom digital decks for the games I play, including a minimalist scifi deck and an animal-based tarot-poker deck. They're designed for use with Obsidian.md's Solo RPG Toolkit, but they're all .pngs so you can use them in any online card drawer (AFAIK) or print them out (at your own risk because I haven't done that and have no idea how I would).

**Note:** I used NightCafe to create the images in my decks.

## Starmap

The Starmap Poker deck comes with the usual 4-suit 52-card deck plus two jokers and a card back so you can use them with Jonathan Heard's inlineScripts plugin or the Solo RPG Toolkit.
